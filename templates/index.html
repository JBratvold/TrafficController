            <h1>About the Traffic-Controller System</h1>
            
            <!-- Overview Section -->
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This AI-driven system optimizes <em>traffic light timing</em> to improve traffic 
                flow at intersections. By analyzing real-time data, such as the number of cars
                waiting at signals and the time elapsed since the last light change, it reduces 
                congestion and enhances traffic efficiency.
            </p>
            
            <!-- How It Works Section -->
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                The system collects real-time data from traffic sensors at the intersection 
                and uses a neural network to predict whether or not the traffic lights should 
                change, based on the training data it learned from. By continuously analyzing 
                current traffic conditions, the AI dynamically adjusts the traffic light to 
                optimize flow, reduce congestion, and adapt to changing traffic patterns.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Note:</strong> To minimize network strain 
                and ensure optimal system performance, API calls to the neural network are made every 5 seconds.
            </p>                  
            
            <!--AI Algorithms and Specifics -->
            <h2>AI Training and Learning</h2>
            <p>
                The AI system is trained using a dataset of historical traffic patterns. 
                During training, the neural network employs 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">Supervised Learning</a> 
                with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification">Binary Classification</a> 
                to understand how different traffic conditions influence optimal light timings. 
                The model uses activation functions like 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)">ReLU</a> for hidden layers 
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">Sigmoid</a> for
                the output layer, enabling it to make binary predictions. The training process also uses 
                <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-cross-entropy-log-loss-for-binary-classification/">
                Binary Cross-Entropy</a> as the loss function to optimize the model's performance. 
                Once trained, the model is used to predict whether or not to change the light, based on 
                real-time traffic data.
            </p>                                                          
        
            <!-- Car Movement and Spawning -->
            <h2>How Cars Spawn and Move</h2>
            <p>
                Cars are randomly generated at the edges of the intersection and move according to 
                the traffic light signals. You can also spawn a car using the <i>manual controls</i>. 
                If a car enters the intersection just as the light turns red, it will accelerate
                to exit the intersection faster.
            </p>
            
            
            <!-- Manual Controls -->
            <h2>Manual Controls</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Change Light:</strong> Click to cycle through the red and green lights, manually controlling traffic flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Car:</strong> Click to spawn a new car at a random edge of the intersection.</li>
                <li><strong>Pause/Resume:</strong> Pause or resume the simulation to observe traffic flow changes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Key Benefits Section -->
            <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduced Congestion:</strong> Shorter wait times at red lights, improving traffic flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Smoother Driving:</strong> Fewer stop-and-go situations, resulting in a more pleasant driving experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptive to Traffic Fluctuations:</strong> Instant adjustments to changing traffic conditions for maximum efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Optimized traffic management reduces fuel consumption and emissions.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Closing Section -->
            <p>
                As the AI continues to learn from each data point, the system becomes smarter, 
                driving even more efficient and adaptive traffic control, transforming how 
                intersections are managed.
            </p>
