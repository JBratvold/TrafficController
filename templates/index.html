        <h2>Traffic Light Simulation</h2>
      <p>
        This website simulates the control of traffic lights at an intersection using an AI-driven system. 
        Users can interact with the traffic light by manually changing its state or observing the AI in action as it controls the traffic flow in real time.
      </p>
      <h2>How the Traffic Light is Controlled</h2>
      <p>
        The traffic light in this simulation is controlled by a custom-built neural network, which is trained to manage the flow of traffic at an intersection. 
        The neural network takes in various inputs such as the number of cars waiting at each light. 
        Based on this information, the network dynamically adjusts the light phases to optimize the flow of traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
        This neural network is capable of learning and adapting to different traffic patterns, making decisions that would otherwise require human intervention. 
        Over time, it gets better at managing traffic efficiently by responding to the real-time conditions of the intersection.
